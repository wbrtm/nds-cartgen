# nds-cartgen

A Python script that sticks image files as cartridge labels onto Nintendo DS game cards and outputs the result as a jpg file. Designed for batch processing.

## Install
1. Make sure python3 is installed
1. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
1. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow`
1. Create subdirectories `carts` and `carts/thumbnails` in the project directory

## Use
* `$python image_processing.py <path to label images>`
* The label images should be named according to the Nintendo DS [cartridge code pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/bux2j3/nintendo_cartridge_codes_decoded_what_that_number/). Supported codes are listed below.

| Code | Meaning | Result |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `NTR-____-___` | Standard cart | Standard NDS-cart |
| `TWL-____-___` | DSi enhanced cart | Standard NDS-cart |
| `NTR-I___-___` | Infrared cart | Black/slightly red NDS-cart |
